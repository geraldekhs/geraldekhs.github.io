I am a Engineering Product Development (EPD) graduate from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), with a specialisation in Robotics. I love pushing the boundaries of mechanical design, especially through 3D printing.

Beyond engineering, I have a keen interest in Computer Science, particularly in areas like mobile robotics algorithms and game development. I find it both exciting and essential, as I believe computational techniques can enhance engineering efficiency and even achieve what traditional engineering alone cannot. 

My interest in game development stems from my hobby of gaming. Furthermore, game design allows imaginative ideas that can transcend the laws of physics.

Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
